Place resume files in this folder.

Preferred file name: resume.pdf
Alternate supported name: HarishV-Resume.pdf
Optional fallback: placeholder.pdf (used when main file is not present)

Notes:
- This project serves static assets from src/assets/... at build time.
- The UI will attempt to preview and allow downloading the resume via a modal.
- If no file is present, the modal shows a friendly message guiding you to add one.
